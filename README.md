# Conquer-Clone
Conquer is free Bootstrap template from templatemo website.
I have cloned it Using plain vanilla Html, Css, and Javascript.
The key aspect of this site is the parallax effect on the images.

For the images to appear on github pages i've changed the url to images 
Example: url('/img/1-1.jpg') to url('../img/1-1.jpg') 
If downloaded this will need to be changed to run images.
